## MalariAI : Automated Malaria Cell Segmentation from Blood Smear Images Using Computer Vision and Deep Learning Techniques

#### Problem Statement
<div align="justify">
   Malaria, a life-threatening disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, remains a global health challenge, particularly in regions with limited access to healthcare resources. One of the key components in the diagnosis of malaria is the microscopic examination of blood smear images to detect and quantify the presence of malaria-infected red blood cells. Traditional manual methods for cell segmentation and parasite detection are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and subject to inter-observer variability. To address these challenges, there is an urgent need for automated malaria cell segmentation systems that can assist healthcare professionals in making accurate and timely diagnoses.

#### Dataset

<div align="justify">
Data came from three different labsâ€™ ex vivo samples of P. vivax infected patients in Manaus, Brazil, and Thailand. The Manaus and Thailand data were used for training and validation while the Brazil data were left out as our test set. Blood smears were stained with Giemsa reagent, which attaches to DNA and allow experts to inspect infected cells and determine their stage.
